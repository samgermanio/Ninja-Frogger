# Ninja Frogger

Ninja Frogger is a simple platform game developed in the Godot engine. It was the first test game I developed on my own and I'm very excited about the end result.

# Gameplay
In Ninja Frogger, you control a frog ninja who has to cross different levels full of obstacles while collecting apples. 

# Controls
Arrow keys: move the frog ninja;

Spacebar: jump

# Levels
The game currently only has two different levels.

# Development
Ninja Frogger was developed using the Godot engine as part of DIO's bootcamp on developing games using this engine. I chose to test Godot while practicing what I learned in the bootcamp.

The game was developed in GDScript, Godot's programming language. The assets used are in the public domain and available at: https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/tiny-swords.
